## 1 Introduction

*Here you introduce the product. Keep this  clean and simple, one or two sentences at most.*
This project aims to create a mobile app that will allow users to search and apply for jobs. The app will feature a user-friendly interface and will be available on Android devices.

## 2 Process Description

*Project development process description as a set of activities; for each development process activity, provide the following:*

- *Activity name (verb or verb phrase)*
- *Activity description (concise paragraph)*
- *Entrance criteria (inputs needed for the activity)*
- *Exit criteria (outputs produced by the activity and how you know it has been completed satisfactorily)*


The project development process is a series of activities that are used to create a new product or service. The process begins with the identification of a need or opportunity, and ends with the delivery of the finished product or service. In between, there are a number of steps that must be completed, including:
1. Inception 
- The goal of the Inception phase is to establish the viability of the proposed system. The tasks that a project team performs during Inception include the following:
- Defining the scope of the system (that is, what's in and what's out)
The purpose of this project is to create a system that will allow users to create and manage their job searches. The system will allow users to create a profile, search for jobs, apply for jobs, and track their progress. The system will also provide a way for users to manage their job search preferences, such as the types of jobs they are interested in and the location they are looking for.
- Outlining a candidate architecture.
The architecture of the application will be a monolithic architecture. A monolithic architecture is an architecture in which all the components of the application are combined into a single unit. This makes the application easier to develop and deploy, but it can be more difficult to maintain and scale.The database will be a SQLite database. SQLite is a relational database management system that is embedded in the application. This means that the database is stored in a file on the device, and it does not require a separate server.
- Identifying critical risks and determining when and how the project will address them.
1. One risk is that the application will not be scalable. This means that the application will not be able to handle a large number of users.
Our solution to this is to implement caching. Caching is a technique that stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the load on the database. This can help improve the application's performance and make it more scalable.
2. Another risk is that the application will not be secure. This means that the data in the application will be vulnerable to attack.
Our solution to this is to implement secure coding practices. Ensure that your development team follows secure coding practices, such as using input validation, implementing secure authentication and authorization, and using encryption for sensitive data.
3. A third risk is that the application will not be easy to maintain. This means that it will be difficult to update the application when new features are needed.
Our solution to this is to implement secure coding practices. Use a version control system like Git to track changes in the codebase. This can help you keep track of changes made to the code and roll back changes if necessary.
4. A fourth risk is that the application will not be easy to deploy. This means that it will be difficult to make changes to the application and then deploy the changes to production.
Our solution to this is to monitor the deployment process and log any errors or issues that occur. This can help you identify and address any issues quickly, reducing downtime and improving the reliability of the deployment process.
- Entry requirements for the inception phase deliverables include: 
  - Vision document with general vision of the core projectâ€™s requirements, key features, and main constraints. 
  - Initial use - case model
  - Initial project glossary 
  - Initial business case
  - Initial project plan and risk assessment.
- Exit criteria for the inception phase deliverables include: 
  - Stakeholder concurrence on scope, definition, and cost/schedule estimates
  - Requirements understanding as evidenced by the fidelity of the primary use cases.
  - Credibility of the cost/schedule estimates, priorities, risks, and development process
  - Depth and breadth of any prototype that was developed

2. Elaboration
- The goal of the Elaboration phase is to refine the system architecture and to develop a detailed plan for the construction phase. The tasks that a project team performs during Elaboration include the following:
  - Developing a more detailed architecture, based on the candidate architecture defined in Inception.
  - Developing a detailed plan for the construction phase, including estimates of cost, effort, schedule, and product quality.
  - Developing a detailed test plan.
  - Developing a detailed quality assurance plan.
  - Developing a detailed project management plan.
- Entry requirements for the elaboration phase deliverables include: 
  - Almost complete use-case model
  - Supplementary requirements including non-functional requirements
  - Refined software architecture
  - Design model, test cases, executable prototype.

- Exit criteria for the inception phase deliverables include: 
  - Stable vision and architecture.
  - Resolved or addressed major risks within the prototype.
  - A developed and accurate project plan.
  - Stakeholders agree that vision can be achieved with the current plan.

3. Construction 
- The goal of the Construction phase is to build the system. The tasks that a project team performs during Construction include the following:
  - Coding the system.
  - Testing the system.
  - Integrating the system.
  - Deploying the system.
- Entry requirements for the elaboration phase deliverables include: 
  - Almost complete use-case model
  - Supplementary requirements including non-functional requirements
  - Refined software architecture
  - Design model, test cases, executable prototype.

- Exit criteria for the inception phase deliverables include: 
  - Stable vision and architecture.
  - Resolved or addressed major risks within the prototype.
  - A developed and accurate project plan.
  - Stakeholders agree that vision can be achieved with the current plan.


4. Transition 
- The goal of the Transition phase is to deploy the system and to support it in production. The tasks that a project team performs during Transition include the following:
  - Deploying the system to production.
  - Training users on the system.
  - Supporting the system in production.
  - Entry requirements for the elaboration phase deliverables include: 
  - To satisfy the user requirements.
  - The actual resource expenditures should not exceed the planned expenditures.
- Exit criteria for the transition phase deliverables include: 
  - Project completed
  - Project in use
  - Lessons learnt
