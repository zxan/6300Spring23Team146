# Design Description

1. When the app is started, the user is presented with the main menu, which allows the user to (1) enter or edit current job details, (2) enter job offers, (3) adjust the comparison settings, or (4) compare job offers (disabled if no job offers were entered yet).   

A: To realize this requirement, I introduced the JobCompareService class as the entry point to the application.  
Then I added displayMainMenu method to show the choices to the user.  

2. When choosing to enter current job details, a user will:
   * Be shown a user interface to enter (if it is the first time) or edit all the details of their current job, which consist of:
     * Title
     * Company
     * Location (entered as city and state)
     * Cost of living in the location (expressed as an index)
     * Yearly salary
     * Yearly bonus
     * Restricted Stock Unit Award (expressed as a lump sum vested over 4 years)
     * Relocation stipend (A single value from $0 to $25,000)
     * Personal Choice Holidays (A single overall number of days from 0 to 20)
   * Be able to either save the job details or cancel and exit without saving, returning in both cases to the main menu.  
   
 A: To realize this requirement, I created a new class Job with attributes title, company, location, costIndex, salary, bonus, rsu,   relocateStipend, and holidays.
 Besides, I also included the id and isCurrentJob attribute, and setAsCurrentJob method to label the current job.
 And in the JobCompareService class, I used a Map structrue to store all jobs with the id as key.
 Besides, I use another currentJob attribute to record the currentJob.
 When user choose to enter of edit current job details, the system will first check if currentJob attribute is null.  
 If currentJob is null, then enter a new one by calling the method createNewJob(call the construciton method in Job class) and setCurrentJob.
 Else if currentJob is not null, then I added editJob method to the Job class to resolve the edit requirement.
 Besides, the createNewJob method can be reused in the next step for normal other offers.

3. When choosing to enter job offers, a user will:
   * Be shown a user interface to enter all the details of the offer, which are the same ones listed above for the current job.
   * Be able to either save the job offer details or cancel.
   * Be able to (1) enter another offer, (2) return to the main menu, or (3) compare the offer (if they saved it) with the current job details (if present).

A: The enter new job offer requirement can be realized by reusing the createNewJob method in last step.  
After that, I added a new method compareWithCurrentJob to realize the comparison.
To compare the offer with current job, the system will pass the new entered offer as a parameter.
The compareWithCurrentJob method will call the toFullString method of currentJob and new entered offer to get a full informaiton.

4. When adjusting the comparison settings, the user can assign integer weights to:
   * Yearly salary
   * Yearly bonus
   * Restricted Stock Unit Award
   * Relocation stipend
   * Personal Choice Holidays  
If no weights are assigned, all factors are considered equal.

A: To realize this requirement, I introduced a new class Weight to store the weight information.  
All parameters within this class will be static, and could be used by all job instances.  
And it will have default 1 value and ready to be used once start the system.  
The user could use set method to modify the private parameters.

5. When choosing to compare job offers, a user will:
   * Be shown a list of job offers, displayed as Title and Company, ranked from best to worst (see below for details), and including the current job (if present), clearly indicated.
   * Select two jobs to compare and trigger the comparison.
   * Be shown a table comparing the two jobs, displaying, for each job:
     * Title
     * Company
     * Location
     * Yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
     * Yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
     * Restricted Stock Unit Award
     * Relocation stipend
     * Personal Choice Holidays
   * Be offered to perform another comparison or go back to the main menu.

A: To realize this requirement, I introduced a getScore method in the Job class using the static Weight info.  
In the JobCompareService entry point, the displayJobsByRank method will sort the jobs based on the score.  
And for the Title, Company, and isCurrentJob information, a toShortString method is built within the Job class.
Another option is to save a score parameter in the Job class. But if so, the score of all jobs should be updated once the weight changes.
As the displayJobsByRank method is not a frequent request, it is better to use a lazy update stratagy by just call the getScore method when necessary.

6. When ranking jobs, a jobâ€™s score is computed as the weighted sum of:  
AYS + AYB + (RSUA / 4) + RELO + (PCH * AYS / 260)  
where:
   * AYS = yearly salary adjusted for cost of living
   * AYB = yearly bonus adjusted for cost of living
   * RSU = restricted stock unit award
   * RELO = relocation stipend
   * PCH = personal choice holidays  
     For example, if the weights are 2 for the yearly salary, 2 for relocation stipend and 1 for all other factors, the score would be computed as:  
   2/7 * AYS + 1/7 * AYB + 1/7 * (RSUA / 4) + 2/7 * RELO + 1/7 * (PCH * AYS / 260)

A: This score can be calculated by introducing the getScore method in the Job class.  
The using the static Weight parameter, the method could calcuate an up-to-date score for a job instance.
The score will be calculated when a job instance is created using the default weight, and when displayJobsByRank using the up-to-date Weight.

7. The user interface must be intuitive and responsive.

A: To realize this requirement, the displayMenu and enterChoice method will be well designed.  
For text interface, the main idea is to provide enough notes to help the user to enter the input one by one, instead of all at once, which will be more user friendly.
Besides, it will examine the format, and once examine failed, it will give the user another chance to enter a new input.  
For example, once a number is required, but receive a String, the system will remind the user to enter a number again.
And the UI can also be implemented through other formats later like Android.

8. For simplicity, you may assume there is a single system running the app (no communication or saving between devices is necessary).

A: Currently, no user and authentication/authorization features introduced. But the system is open to the extension if needed later.
