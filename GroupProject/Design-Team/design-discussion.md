<!-- Jiaâ€™s UML (./images/jiadesign.png) (./images/teamdesign.png) will need to be updated bc of Hashmap. Create images folder under Group project and upload png for uml embedding. Feel free to make any edits here.-->

## Team Design
![image](./images/teamdesign.png)
Our main commonalities for the design are the Job class and its attributes. The team design also shares a hashmap for the Job data structure. The main design differences are the reduced amount of Classes. Compare_Jobs and Comparison Settings are merged into a single Class. The same is said for Job, Job_Offers, and Current_Job. This team design was selected based on the principle of simplicity and avoiding over-complication of the project.

## Summary
Our group chose Jia's UML diagram for our team design because of its simple and concise layout.
